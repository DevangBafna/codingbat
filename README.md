# Codingbat Exercises

This is the base repo for codingbat (https://codingbat.com/python) exercises. For each type of exercises, I provided solution to the first question. You can follow my coding style (docstrings, testing, etc.) to solve the rest of questions.

This exercise is optional. There is no grading pressure or timing pressure. However, I strongly recommand you try all the questions without other's help. **DO NOT google the solutions.**  

## How to submit

1. **Fork** this base repository.
2. **Clone** the forked repository (`https://github.com/<your-id>/codingbat`) to your computer. This repository should be a different folder from `oim3640` folder or any other GitHub repository folder.
3. Read [my solution demo code](warmup-1/sleep_in.py) before you start.
4. **Commit and push** to GitHub when you finish one or several exercises. Check the update on your personal GitHub page.
5. If you have difficulty solving problems, you can eiter
    - mention me in **Issues** of your `codingbat` repo
    - or create a **pull request** to the base repo
    - or DM me on **Slack**.
6. (Occasionally, in fact very rarely) If I need to check your progress in solving codingbat problems, I will ask you to create a pull request to my base repo and we will have a Coding Chat the following days. 

Please let me know if you have any questions/concerns/comments.
